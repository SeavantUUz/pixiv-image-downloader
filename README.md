**update on 2013 8 7:**

The old version could not run correctily,so I rewrited it and now it looks fine.
You can simpliy use it as old way.
And I use requests to instead of machanize.

The only dependence is requests. You can get it by git: [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) or use pip
